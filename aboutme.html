    <p>Hi. My name is Madison, but I go by Maddy for short. I'm 14 and My birthday is on April 1st 2004. I have blonde hair and blue/green eyes. I (sometimes) wear glasses. I go to Saint Kentigern College. The schools that I used to go to are Hillsborough Primary School and Saint Kentigern Girls school. One of my hobbies is playing guitar/ukulele/baritone uke/bass or literally any other instrument lying around if I have the time to learn how to play it. As well as playing music, I like listening to it. Some of my favourite bands/artists are Twenty One Pilots, Panic! At The Disco, Billie Eilish, Cavetown, Paramore, Metallica, Keaton Henson and Fall Out Boy, but those are just to name a few. I also enjoy taking care of animals, I have over 20 of them. My favourite animals are parrots. I have 3 cockateils named Blanco, Cosmo and Pearl. I also used to do a bit of work at a parrot pet store and have babysit parrots before. I really like collecting essential or fragrancce oils and crystals. All this aside, like many other teenagers, I spend most of my free time sleeping, or on the internet. </p>
